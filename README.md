## TypeDB's Benchmarking System

TypeDB Benchmark is the benchmarking system for [TypeDB](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb). It serves two main purposes: benchmarking TypeDB itself, allowing for comparisons between different TypeDB versions; and comparing the performance of TypeDB against other database systems.

Currently, TypeDB Benchmark supports running TypeDB, TypeDB Cluster, and Neo4j. More databases will be added in the future.

Reasoning query benchmarks are supported for TypeDB and TypeDB Cluster, but cannot be used in comparison tests.
